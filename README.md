# Neural-Network

Machine Learning can be divided roughly into three categories:
  1. Supervised Learning (We know the labels of the data)
  2. Unsupervised Learning (We do not know the labels of the data)
  3. Reinforcement Learning (We try to make our algorithm to learn from feedback)

This project is an example of supervised learning with neural networks.

Neural Network is a computational model, which tries to implement the human brain. Neural Networks make decisions based on the preset training data. 

The simplest Neural Network takes as an input two variables with specific weights and bias. An output is created based on the input. The model can be trained by changing the weights or bias to match a specific output.

After we have trained our network, we can give it input values, and the network should be capable of determing the output correctly.
